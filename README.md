# Metabucket

Metabucket is an example JavaScript/HTML application that displays a [Google
Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/products/cloud-storage) bucket. The
application can be uploaded to a Google Cloud Storage bucket using the [Website
Configuration]
(https://developers.google.com/storage/docs/website-configuration), thereby
creating a bucket that displays its own content.
